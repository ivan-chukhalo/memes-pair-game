# pair-game

This project is an implementation of [one of the tasks](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/2022_UA/tasks/memory-pair-game.md) of the non-commercial Front-End course from the Ukrainian [Kottans](https://kottans.org/) community. 

The application is a card game in which all cards are placed on the surface face down and in one turn the player turns over two cards. The goal of the game is to find pairs of matching cards. The game ends when the last pair is matched.

You can try the game at this [link](https://ivan-chukhalo.github.io/pair-game/).
